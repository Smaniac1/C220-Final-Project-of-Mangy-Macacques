This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of coronavirus, we thought about an optimistic future when a vaccine is invented and doctors have the ability to effectively kill the virus. We wanted to portray this desperate hope.

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it: 
  Version control was a big sticking point. Working remotely together required constant uploads and merges that often had conflicts that needed to be resolved.
  Bug fixing was also a big problem. Searching for bugs when we didn't even know what the problem was, especially if the debugger provided nothing helpful.
  Finding a consistent style was also a point of issue. We all had different ideas, so trying to find a way to meld them all together to create something cohesive was difficult.

These are the technologies and resources we used:
  We used Github online and Github Desktop, as well as Godot for our engine. Microsoft picture editing tools, Adobe Photoshop and Audition were the other software used.
  Art assets are from kenney.nl, sound assets are from freegamesound.org, and music from Patrick de Arteaga

This is the objective of the game:
  Kill enemies. Pick up pills. Find the boss and defeat it.

This is how the game is played:
  WASD for directional movement, space to jump, left click to shoot left and right click to shoot right.

Future plans:
  Add in multiple levels, a save and load feature, a greater variety of enemies, powerups, new projectile tools.
